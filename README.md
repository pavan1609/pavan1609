Hi, I'm **Pavankumar Chandankar**, currently pursuing my Master's degree in Mechatronics at the University of Siegen. With a strong foundation in embedded systems and a passion for automation and machine learning, I've worked on several innovative projects that span from real-time communication systems to 3D environment localization.

## üöÄ Professional Experience

- **Larsen and Toubro**  
  Embedded Engineer - Graduate Engineer
  - Contributed to remote testing of Shinkansen-compatible rail control system firmware (C++/Embedded C) using dSPACE HIL and Vector CANoe, ensuring
real-time performance and data integrity.
  - Assisted in automating ADAS testing using python for emergency braking, obstacle detection, and train control automation.
  - Supported development of test automation frameworks (Jenkins) and generated documentation for firmware performance and safety compliance (LDRA Testbed).
  - Gained experience in embedded systems testing, test automation, and remote collaboration within a large-scale, safety-critical project (JIRA, Confluence).
  - Inspected COTS hardware with Eplan P8, ensuring industry compliance and establishing CAN bus communication for a ‚Ç¨7 billion rail project.

- **Tata Hitachi**  
  Process Engineer - Intern  
  - Hands-on experience with optimized control algorithms for microcontrollers, SBCs, and robot controllers, focusing on PWM modulation and signal processing for precision control.
  - Optimized material handling equipment through simulations, implementing PID tuning and feedback control loops.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

- **[Vehicle Telemetry Mapping](#)**  
  Developed an application to visualize real-time vehicle trace analysis, incorporating simulated diagnostics for error ticket creation. Utilized Python for data processing, mapping, and visualization.

- **[Safety-Critical Automotive CAN Bus Anomaly Detection](#)**  
  Developed safety-critical firmware for a simulated automotive CAN bus network (CANoe) with sensor applications, adhering to J1939. Implemented a ML based anomaly detection system to enhance real-time fault tolerance

- **[Human Activity Recognition](#)**  
  Developed a novel approach using the WEAR dataset to Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for segmentation, DBA for data augmentation, and TCNs to capture long-range dependencies.

- **[Automated Focus-Enhancing Companion](#)**  
  Designed a prototype for an automated focus-enhancing system using JavaScript, C#, React, TypeScript, and fastAPI. Implemented performance tracking, secure data handling with AES encryption, and adaptive user interfaces.

- **[3D Environment Localization via Sensor Fusion](#)**  
  Leveraged Microsoft Kinect and TurtleBot with ROS for depth estimation via inertial sensors and ray-tracing, reverse-projecting sensor data to simulate a 3D environment.
